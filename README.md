# WakeMate
A lightweight utility that keeps your system awake
Wake Mate is a lightweight and user-friendly desktop utility designed to prevent your computer from going into sleep mode or triggering screen savers by periodically simulating mouse movements. This app runs quietly in the background and ensures that your system stays active even during periods of inactivityâ€”perfect for scenarios where system sleep could interrupt your workflow or connectivity.

# Use Case:
Imagine you're attending a long virtual meeting, webinar, or remote training session where you need to stay logged in, but there's minimal interaction on your part. Many corporate systems automatically lock the screen or go to sleep after a short idle period, which can be disruptive or even interpreted as non-participation. Wake Mate solves this problem by gently moving the mouse at regular intervals, mimicking activity so your system remains awake and engaged without interfering with your actual usage. This makes it an ideal companion for professionals, students, or IT administrators who need to keep their systems responsive without manual input.
